WEATHER DATA ANALYSIS

This is a beginner project for data analysis with Python. I have used a real weather dataset and Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to clean the data, derive insights, and visualize patterns.

The data was cleaned by dropping duplicates and imputing missing values on the basis of temperature. I determined simple statistics such as average and max temperature, normalized the data via NumPy, and coded manually a 7-day rolling average without applying inherent Pandas functions.

There are a couple of primary plots in the project: one illustrating humidity vs temperature with the peak temperature emphasized, and another illustrating original vs rolling average temp.
